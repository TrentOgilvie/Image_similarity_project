# Image_similarity_project
Compare images using deep learning! Generates similarity scores &amp; difference maps. Applications: Art History: Analyze artworks, detect forgeries. Environmental History: Track deforestation, urban growth via aerial imagery.

Description:
This project uses a Siamese neural network to compare two images and measure their similarity. It generates a detailed difference map to visually highlight differences between the images, along with a similarity score ranging from 0.0 (completely different) to 1.0 (identical). The project leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and includes tools for preprocessing, training, and visualization.

Key Features:
Siamese Network: A deep learning model designed for similarity detection.

Feature Extraction: Uses pre-trained VGG16 to extract low-, mid-, and high-level features.

Difference Maps: Visualizes differences between images at multiple feature levels.

Similarity Score: Quantifies how similar two images are on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

Synthetic Data Generation: Creates training data with varying degrees of similarity.

Applications:
1. Art History: Comparing Artworks
Purpose: Analyze and compare artworks to identify similarities, influences, or forgeries.

Use Cases:

Style Comparison: Detect similarities in artistic styles across different periods or artists.

Forgery Detection: Identify subtle differences between original artworks and potential forgeries.

Restoration Analysis: Compare pre- and post-restoration images to evaluate restoration work.

Example: Compare two paintings by different artists to determine if one was influenced by the other.

2. Environmental History: Analyzing Aerial Imagery
Purpose: Study changes in landscapes, ecosystems, or urban areas over time.

Use Cases:

Deforestation Monitoring: Compare aerial images of forests over time to track deforestation.

Urban Development: Analyze changes in urban landscapes to study historical growth patterns.

Climate Change Impact: Compare historical and current images of glaciers, coastlines, or wetlands to assess environmental changes.

Example: Compare aerial images of a forest from 1990 and 2020 to quantify deforestation.

Repository Contents:
Code:

image_similarity.ipynb: Google Colab notebook for image comparison.

siamese_network.py: Python script for building and training the Siamese network.

preprocess.py: Script for image preprocessing.

Example Workflow:
Upload two images (e.g., two paintings or aerial photos).

Preprocess the images and generate feature maps.

Compute the similarity score and generate a difference map.

Visualize the results, including the difference heatmap and overlay.
